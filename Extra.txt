Some code for this program was taken from the programs youtube-dl
(http://www.arrakis.es/~rggi3/youtube-dl/) and pornotube-dl
(http://www.arrakis.es/~rggi3/pornotube-dl/);
I tried to mention when borrowed code was used in the source code
for this program but I might have missed things. Those two programs
are much more robust programs than this is and I would suggest that
people check those out. Those programs are licensed under the MIT license
which does allow use of the code in a GPL program as long as the original copyright
and license terms are present. The following is a copy of the copyright notice
and MIT license taken from those programs.

The Windows version of this program bundles an executable for ffmpeg. The program is licensed under the GPL. This program uses the compiled executable
from that project so no modification has been made. As such,
I will point out where to get the binary and the source code for ffmpeg.
I think that this is all that needs to be done to comply with the GPL in this case
but feel free to contact me and let me know if there is more that I have to do.


FFmpeg info:

Binary: http://ffmpeg.arrozcru.org/builds/static/ffmpeg-r13712-gpl-static-win32.tar.bz2
Source: http://ffmpeg.arrozcru.org/builds/source/ffmpeg-r13712.tar.bz2


The Windows version of this program also bundles portions of GTK that are needed to render
the GUI version.
